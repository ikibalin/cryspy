**CrysPy** is a crystallographic python library for polarized neutron diffraction data analysis.
The package allows the data treatment both for powders and single-crystal samples. Nuclear and (commensurate) magnetic structures refinement can be also perfomed based on the unpolarized neutron diffraction and X-ray diffraction data.

Features
--------
- CrysPy allows one to analyse the local magnetic anisotropy by the susceptibility approach  and the spin/magnetization densities reconstruction by maximume entropy procedure based on polarized neutron diffraction experiments;
- Core CIF dictionary of the  IUCr is used to cover the requirements of archiving and exchanging the data and derived magnetic and structural results;
- The library is written in Python. It can be used in Jupyter notebooks under the main platforms Windows, MacOSX and Linux or as a standalone application with a simple graphical user interface "CrysPy Editor".
